v0.1.0
```
iSed (interactive sed) is a small script that allows you to see what your sed command will change, before making those changes.

The script wraps sed and [icdiff](https://github.com/jeffkaufman/icdiff).

## Demo

## Installation

- Install `icdiff` using `pip`.
```bash
pip install icdiff
```
- Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mochitto/iSed.git 
```
- Turn the script into an executable.
- Move it to your bin directory to run it with `iSed`.

## Usage

iSed has the same interface as `sed`.

Once you define your command, you will be shown a git-style diff, where you can evaluate if to continue or not.

To do this, the script pipes the output of sed to a temporary file, that overwrites the original if the changes are deemed correct.

### Notice!
It will not prevent you from changing the file in place with `sed`'s `-i` flag.  
It's also important to put the file to change as last argument (I'm new to scripting, hopefully someone can help make this better).
```bash
iSed -r "s/foo/bar/g" my_file.txt
```
